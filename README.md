Monster Tamer - Pokemon like RPG Tutorial with Phaser 3

A Pokemon like game created using [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)!

This is the official code repository for the [Monster Tamer - Pokemon like RPG Tutorial with Phaser 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcXe0-sfoSgq-pyXrFx0GZjHbvoVUW8t) series available on YouTube.

## Local Setup

This project is currently setup to require a very minimal amount of tools to run the web application. The main tools that are needed are:

- IDE (Integrated Development Environment), or any program you can use to edit code.
  - In the video tutorial series linked above, I use the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and this code base has some out of the box settings and extensions that are recommended for formatting and running the code.
- A local web server, this is needed due to browser security and how we are loading files with the Phaser 3 framework for our game.
  - You can use any local web server you are familiar with, however if you use VS Code, I recommend the following extension [LiveServer by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Downloading Assets

By default, none of the audio and image assets are included in the code repository. As the size of the project grows, it was chosen to omit these files and to instead provide a link to zipped folder that contains the assets that are used in this project. You find the latest assets for this game here: [Latest Game Assets](https://github.com/devshareacademy/monster-tamer/releases/download/assets/all-game-assets.zip).

After you have downloaded the assets, you will need to place those folders in the `/assets` folder.

## How To Play

Currently, the only supported way to play the game is with a Keyboard. The game has not been tested with a Gamepad at this time, but will be supported in the future.
